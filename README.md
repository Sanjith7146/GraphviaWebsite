Graphiva simplifies learning complex graph algorithms like Dijkstra's Algorithm, BFS, and DFS, making it the perfect tool for competitive programmers, students, and educators. With Graphiva, you can visualize and interact with graph theories dynamically, bridging the gap between theory and practice.

Create and customize graphs easily by adding nodes, forming edges, and adjusting edge weights. Watch algorithms in action as Graphiva highlights paths step-by-step, helping you understand how they work. To deepen your learning, the app displays pseudocode alongside the visualizations, offering a clear connection to programming logic.

What you can do in Graphiva:
  • Interactive graph building
  • Real-time algorithm visualizations
  • Step by Step analysis and adjust the graph on the go for a comprehensive learning experience
  • Learn the theories behind each algorithm (Coming soon!)
  • View the pseudocode used for making the algorithm.
